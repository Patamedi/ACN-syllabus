Congratulations on successfully building your prototype and putting it to the test! Next, we’d like you to present back to us and take us through your process.

Reflect on the following questions: What feedback did you get, and how might you further refine your idea? – What surprised you about this process? – What other things might you wish to re-design in a process like this?

**Presentation time:** 10h00 - 12h00, 10min p.p.
