## **The Don Draper Dream**

Of course we all want live the dream like Don and be as captivating in our writing as we are groundbreaking in our ideas. Trust me, we all have said we are going to the best copywriter alive (rolls eyes). To be hinest, there is absolutely nothing wrong with this dream, well except that most people dont even know what it takes to be a great copy writer. It's not as clear and simple as being a great sportsman, because that entails being at your sport. Being a good copywriter , which in part means being a good writer, has a lot to do with being a good human.

Ever heard a song so beautifully written that swore on your previous relationship's grave that it had to be written with you in mind? Or loved a character on a series so much that when they died in the show you cried so much you couldnt sleep and had to take a day off from work to mourn? Yep, that right there is good writing. The true superpower is not in the content being so well written, but in you the consumer being so **well understood**. That's right, the super human ability here that makes one a good writer and possibly a great copywriter, is... **EMPATHY!**

Hopefully you are slowly realising that copywriting isn't just about how creative you are, but more about how empathic you are with your user, how much you understand about them, and how you use that understanding to communicatewith them.

It's not just about cheesy taglines or forgettable catchphrases, oh Lord no. Copywriting is about achieving a business/ marketing goal using nothing but your understanding of the audience and your wizadry with words. 

The pen is mightier than the sword when you understand the swordsman more than he thinks you do.

### **The Challenge**

**Brief:**

Write a 200 word article on you best understanding and explanation of what copywriting is. This article should do **two things**: firstly, it must inform me on what copywriting is, and secondly, it must persuade me to want to be a part of it. 

Yes, inform me and then convince me. ![Did I stutter?](https://media1.giphy.com/media/p4jcsvuDXsxllLUsp7/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47tav4o5gqfskp4gwn5s6t8iarjlb76cpq19mu8lpw&rid=giphy.gif)
